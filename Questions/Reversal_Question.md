<h3>Imagine a vibrant city with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, each carrying their own stories and experiences. In the heart of this city is a bustling marketplace where individuals gather to share their tales, creating a rich tapestry of narratives.

In this lively setting, there's a unique tradition where people express themselves through words written on colourful banners. However, there's a challenge â€“ the words on these banners are sometimes arranged in a way that doesn't quite capture the essence of the stories.

Our task is to become the city's "Word Reverser." When someone brings a banner with a string of words, our job is to rearrange them in a way that truly reflects the narrative. It's like unraveling the layers of a story, revealing the depth and meaning behind each phrase.</h3>
